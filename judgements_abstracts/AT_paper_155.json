Significant work has been devoted to implementing tools for persistent homology diagrams; however, computing representative cycles corresponding to each point in the diagram can still be inefficient. To circumvent this problem, we extend the twist algorithm of Chen and Kerber. Our extension is based on a new technique we call \\emph{saving}, which supplements their existing \\emph{killing} technique.
