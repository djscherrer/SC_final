Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset. Education Data Portal (Version 0.10.0), Urban\nInstitute, accessed February,\n2021,\\url{https:\/\/educationdata.urban.org\/documentation\/}, made available\nunder the ODC Attribution License.}.\n\n\nWe consider a sample of local expenditures in primary and secondary\neducation, local taxes, enrollment and population estimates for all 50\nUS states and school districts (on average \\textasciitilde{} 13,500), in the 2000-2016\nperiod.  We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent.

In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"ETH Zurich","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Lausanne","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW)","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Cambridge","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Wolverhampton","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Peking University","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}.

Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Dalian University of Technology","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"China University of Mining and Technology","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB)","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Delhi","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Sharif University of Technology","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Ferdowsi University of Mashhad","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}.

Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Houston","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Western Washington University","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Sao Paulo","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Universidade de Bras\u00edlia","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul, PUCRS","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Cairo University","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Zagazig University","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"The University of Melbourne","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}.

Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"The University of Adelaide","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Technical University of Munich","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Potsdam","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"Leibniz University Hannover","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints.

The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}.

We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of Cape Town","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending.

The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$.

In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit.

This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space. Given\nknowledge about the plausible ranges for the scale and location\nparameters, along with the MAP estimates, this choice of weakly\ninformative priors seemed appropriate.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{graphs\/bayes\/mchains.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mctrace}Trace plots for MCMC samples obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 3 chains, 30,000 iterations per chain and 4,000 tuning samples.

The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","input_length":14593,"university_association":"University of the Free State","rating_prompt":"Rate the quality of the paper according to the following criteria on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

Covering the period 2000-2016, I explore how inter-jurisdictional competition and household choice influence spending patterns within the public education sector, providing a novel empirical treatment of the Tiebout hypothesis within a statistical equilibrium framework.  The analysis reveals that these expenditures are characterized by sharply peaked and positively skewed distributions, suggesting significant socio-economic stratification. Employing Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, I fit these patterns into a statistical equilibrium model to elucidate the roles of competition, as well as household mobility and arbitrage in shaping the distribution of educational spending. The analysis reveals how the scale parameters associated with competition and household choice critically shape the equilibrium outcomes. The model and analysis offer a statistical basis for shaping policy measures intended to affect distributional outcomes in scenarios characterized by the decentralized provision of local public goods.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{\nPublic School Expenditures \\and Statistical Equilibrium \\and Bayesian Inference \\and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling \\and Maximum Entropy \\and Tiebout Hypothesis \\and Inter-jurisdictional Competition \\and Fiscal Decentralization \\and Socioeconomic Stratification \\and Fiscal Policy Analysis.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec-1}\n\n\\subsection{Tiebout Competition}\n\\label{sec-1-1}\n\nA central problem in the economic analysis of the provision of local\npublic goods is the lack of incentives of voters to reveal their true\ndemand. \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} proposed to study the problem of\nlocal public goods through a quasi-market model in which\nconsumer-voters express their preferences for local public goods by\nmoving in and out of local jurisdictions.The Tiebout hypothesis states\nthat local jurisdictions will tend to sort into homogenous blocks with\nrespect to demand for local public goods and tax levels, when these\nare taken to be a form of prices in the model. The core idea behind\nthis hypothesis is that a Tiebout sorting equilibrium, if it exists,\nwill eliminate inefficiencies associated with demand diversity;\nhouseholds will not be forced to pay higher tax levels than they would\notherwise prefer, nor are they are able to free-ride on neighboring\nhouseholds' relatively higher contributions to the local tax-service\npackage.\n\nTiebout's 1956 paper was, and continues to be, an important catalyst\nfor renewed research in the analysis of decentralized government\nfinance. Tiebout's major contribution was to challenge the standard\nbelief of the time that there was no market-based solution to the\nproblem of local public goods provision. He did so by placing\ngeographic location and mobility at the core of the analysis, and by\nusing the latter as a proxy for choice and preference revelation.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThere is no way in which the consumer can avoid revealing his\npreferences in a spatial economy. Spatial mobility provides the\nlocal-goods counterpart to the private market's shopping trip.\nTiebout (1956)\n\\end{quote}\n\nWhile \\citet{tiebout_pure_1956} agreed with\n\\citet{musgrave_voluntary_1939} and \\citet{samuelson_pure_1954}, that\nthe determination of federal government expenditures could only have a\npolitical solution, he argued for explaining variations in local\ngovernment expenditures in terms of decentralized sorting mechanisms\n(a market analogy) and not by alluding to simple majority voting\nschemes.\n\nTiebout's hypothesized mechanism of competition, when seen though the\nlens of neoclassical equilibrium models, may be understood as having\nthree essential traits \\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020}. The first is\nthat when local communities are viewed as analogous to competing\nfirms, decentralization will allow for the optimal provision of public\nservices in the presence of heterogeneous household demands. The\nsecond is the notion that competition will reduce incentives for local\ngovernments to behave like `Leviathans' \\citep{jha}. The latter\nnotion rests on the belief that the decentralized procurement and\nprovision of local public goods will counter the tendency of\ngovernments to arbitrarily extract higher taxes from their residents\n\\citep{brennang,jimenez_is_2010}. A third feature implies that in\n'equilibrium', the Tiebout mechanism will lead households to sort (to\nsome degree) on the basis of ability-to-pay and household income. This\nlatter feature is, of course, far from being unequivocally\ndesirable. The characterization of Tiebout sorting as an optimal\noutcome, possessing intrinsic merit mostly on account of its capacity\nto bring about productive efficiencies, turns out to be at odds with\nbasic legal notions regarding citizens' rights to education\n\\citep{jha}. An equilibrium in which public school expenditures\nand quality are highly correlated with household characteristics\npresents non-negligible moral and legal challenges. The scope of these\nchallenges has been duly evidenced by the continued legal battles and\npolicy debates over funding inequities in the US public education\nsystem for the past 50 years\n\\citep{bakere,hertert_school_1994}. The fact that the optimal\noutcome in a highly idealized formulation of the Tiebout hypothesis\nturns out to be fundamentally at odds with what may be desirable at\nthe policy or household level (or is at the very least highly\ncontestable), does not rule out the possibility that sorting and the\nrationing of government resources are in fact shaped by Tiebout-like\nforces. It does however pose serious challenges to the modeling and\nspecification of the microeconomic primitives which drive the\ncompetitive process.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems that comes out of the use of applied\ngeneral equilibrium models is that they force us to consider observed\neconomic distributions as resulting chiefly and mechanically from the\ninteraction of optimizing agents (households and governments) whose\npreferences are fully satisfied. This is a modeling strategy that\nrules out a priori the possibility that agents' expectations will\nremain unfulfilled in equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of the economic analysis of the determinants of\nheterogeneity in public school expenditure levels and demand, where\nmuch of the theoretical and policy debates center around the explicit\nrecognition that education markets are structured by complex political\nand production processes, the requirement that fully optimizing\nbehavior be consistent with observed equilibria is hard to\nsustain. Furthermore, in the absence of plausible characterizations\nfor the microeconomic and political environments, it is hard to see\nhow any useful insights may be extracted from the study of general\nequilibrium forces and outcomes.\n\nThis concern has steered the Tiebout and education finance literature\ntowards a path of building models of increased mathematical and\ncomputational complexity, where elements such as heterogenous voting\npreferences and non-financial inputs are incorporated in order to\nprovide richer descriptions that are more empirically relevant, as\nwell as plausible from a microeconomic perspective\n\\citep{nechyba_school_2003, tim}.\n\nThere has been a recent shift in the literature from building general\nequilibrium models to building computational equilibrium models that\nstraddle a wide spectrum covering both purely theoretical and\nempirically motivated formulations.  As \\citet{nechyba_tiebout_2020}\nnotes, all such models start by explicitly specifying the underlying\nmathematical structure of the economic environment being modeled. That\nis, they provide a fully structural specification for household\npreferences, school production functions, distributions for household\ncharacteristics in the model (such as income), as well as mathematical\ndescriptions for the political process (voting models), the fiscal\nenvironment, and the housing and private school markets. Through\nsimulation studies, the study of the equilibrium outcomes in these\nmodels is then expected to yield meaningful policy insights, and to\nprovide a sandbox for experimenting with out-of-sample policy\ninterventions.\n\nThe problem is that the relevance of these simulation\nstudies hinges on the empirical plausibility of the elaborate\nmicroeconomic structure that is being used to represent the underlying\nmechanics of the data generating process, and on the confidence we may\nhave in the model's parameters to adequately capture empirically\nrelevant processes. But if we consider the fact that the task of\ndetermining the empirical plausibility of any given model\nspecification for complex social environments with large degrees of\nfreedom may be ill-posed and underdetermined \\citep{schafol}, then\nit is hard to see how the route of increasing model complexity in\nfully micro-founded general (or computational) equilibrium models is\nlikely to yield unambiguous and normatively unbiased results. There is\na very broad continuum of models and solutions that are consistent\nwith any set of circumstantial data and evidence\n\\citep{golan_foundations}. And misspecification can show up either\nat the level of functional forms (production and preference\nfunctions), criterion or decision functions, the specification of\nvoting models, as well as priors for stochastic inputs in the model\n(e.g. household characteristics).\n\nThis paper takes an alternative approach that makes use of maximum\nentropy methods and a statistical equilibrium framework to model and\nstudy the effect of competition in shaping the distributions of local\ngovernment education expenditures for the period of 2000-2016 in the\nUnited States. The advantages of this maximum entropy\/statistical\nequilibrium framework are plenty, but a central one that we consider\nhere is that it allows us to study the competitive dynamics of the US\npublic education market (a complex social systems with large degrees\nof freedom) without having to commit \\emph{a priori} to a heavy\nmathematical scaffolding of the underlying microeconomic\nenvironment. Rather, it allows is to study one plausible way in which\nthe probabilistic structure of school district expenditures can be\nseen to emerge from a pair of parsimonious behavioral and institutional\nconstraints that we place on the underlying microeconomic environment.\n\n\\subsection{Unintended Outcomes, Market Efficiency and Tiebout Sorting}\n\\label{sec-1-2}\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Tiebout's original 1956 formulation\nis that it remains non-committal with respect to any specific\nequilibrium model formulation, even if it highlights a set of stylized\nfacts and features that the hypothetical competitive process should\nmeet. But as the history of the empirical tests of the Tiebout\nhypothesis has shown\n\\citep{nechyba_tiebout_2020,oates_effects_1969,edel_taxes_1974},\nit is not truly possible to test all of the assumptions of the larger\nTiebout hypothesis at once without running into contradictions. For\nexample, testing the assumption of residential mobility alongside the\ncapitalization of fiscal variables into housing prices may run against\nTiebout's larger efficiency hypothesis (since the presence of\ncapitalization is evidence for the existence of excess demand for\nhousing in the jurisdiction where taxes and local service levels are\nbeing capitalized) \\citep{epple_fiscal_2004}>. Similarly, as we\npointed above, the existence of Tiebout sorting is to be better\nunderstood as a potentially unexpected macroeconomic outcome (to at\nleast some section of households).  Seen under this light, the\nprospect of being able to reconcile the underlying political\ncontradictions of the education market with the assumption of fully\nmaximizing households in a general equilibrium model seems\nfar-fetched. That said, we believe there is need and ample room to\nfocus on some aspects of the Tiebout hypothesis, and that it is\npossible to study the empirical support for the general claim that\nexpenditures in local public goods are heavily shaped (and at least\npartially explained) by competitive forces and a boundedly rational\narbitrage that takes place at the household level in terms of\neducation consumption.\n\nThis paper applies the theoretical framework of the Quantal Response\nStatistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model developed in \\citet{schafol}. As\nmentioned above, the approach taken by the paper is not fully agnostic\nwith respect to microeconomic structure, as it utilizes an entropy\nconstrained model of residential mobility and jurisdictional choice as\nthe baseline characterization of household behavior. This baseline\nmodel makes the behavioral assumption that households try to maximize\nthe rate of return on tax expenditures (considered as prices for local\neducation services), under the constraint of a limited capacity to\nprocess market and political signals. In the context of low-income and\ninner-city households, we put forward the idea that this limited\ncapacity may also be interpreted as a form of restricted economic\nagency. The basic outline of this behavioral model is very similar to\nthe one found in Sims' rational inattention program\n\\citep{sims_implications_2003}.  Through the inclusion\nof an information-theoretic constraint on the utility maximizing program of\nhouseholds, this baseline specification delivers a meaningful\nprobabilistic description of household behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Sample and Paper Structure}\n\\label{sec-1-3}\n\nThe statistical equilibrium distribution of the QRSE model presented\nhere is a positively skewed unimodal distribution of the household\nrate of return for local tax expenditures, with four parameters $T$,\n$S$, $\\mu$, and $\\alpha$ that qualitatively predict the observed\ndata and give insights into the possible range of variation across\nsub-sampling schemes. We use US public education finance data for all school districts\nin the period of 2000-2016. We then apply Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to fit the observed\ndistribution for the entire period to the theoretical QRSE model, and to recover posterior\ndistributions for the four unknown parameters.\n\nThe paper consists of 5 sections. Section 2 provides a description of\nthe data used and presents empirical the frequency distributions for the\nkey fiscal and expenditure variables used in building the\nmodel. Section 3 puts our application of the QRSE model into context\nby discussing fiscal decentralization, Smith's theory of\ncompetition, and the measurable implications of the Tiebout\nhypothesis. Section 4 then develops the paper's QRSE treatment of\nTiebout competition and derives the statistical equilibrium density\nfor the \\emph{local per pupil rate of return on tax and service charges},\nwhich we term \\emph{educational returns}.  Section 5 describes the\nBayesian estimation of the model, and discusses results for the four\nmain parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{School District Variables}\n\\label{sec-2}\n\n\\subsection{Data}\n\\label{sec-2-1}\n\n\nThis paper uses data from the National Center for Education\nStatistics\u2019 Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education\u2019s\nEDFacts initiative \\footnote{This data has been made available in a\nharmonized format in a publicly available API by the Urban Institute,\nwhich provides a convenient and reliable interface to all the major\nfederal dataset.

We excluded a total of 233 data points (roughly 0.1\\dataset), 58 of which were due to extreme value observations\nattributable to data entry error, and the remaining 175 due to missing\nvalues in one of the outcome variables. The total number of\nobservations for all 50 US states and school districts (on average\n13,500) is $N= 229,553$. The outcome variable we are seeking to characterize is defined as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{xdef}\nx = \\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Education Expenditures}}{Enrollment} -\n\\frac{\\mbox{Total Local Taxes and Charges}}{\\mbox{Population}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe outcome variable $x$ is the \\emph{household per pupil rate of return on tax and\nservice charges}, which we term \\emph{educational returns}.  The variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures} is\naggregated from a large set of expenditure categories in primary and\nsecondary education (K-12) that include \\emph{instruction}, \\emph{textbooks},\n\\emph{pupil support services}, \\emph{staff} , \\emph{transportation},\n\\emph{administration}, \\emph{maintenance}, \\emph{food services}, \\emph{utilities},\n\\emph{supplies}, and \\emph{technology}. We denote the variable \\emph{Total Local\nEducation Expenditures}, scaled by enrollment, as $\\kappa$.\n\nThe variable \\emph{Total Local Taxes and Charges} aggregates the following\nrevenue categories: \\emph{Private contributions}, \\emph{fines and forfeits},\n\\emph{property sales}, \\emph{rents and royalties}, \\emph{sales and services},\n\\emph{individual and corporate income taxes}, \\emph{general fees}, \\emph{public\nutility taxes}, \\emph{general sales taxes}, \\emph{and property taxes}. We denote\nthe variable \\emph{Total Local Education Expenditures}, scaled by school\ndistrict population, as $\\tau$. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to constraints from missing data or comparability across regions\nand years, this paper works with aggregate local revenue categories,\nwithout excluding \\emph{general fees} or \\emph{service charges}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Empirical Distributions}\n\\label{sec-2-2}\n\nBelow we present the marginal empirical distribution for $x$, as\ndefined in formula \\ref{xdef}, for the period $2000-2016$. In figure\n\\ref{tbstack} we plot a stacked histogram with the empirical density\nfor each year in the pooled sample.  The stacked histogram reveals the\npersistent organization of educational returns into highly peaked\nasymmetric distributions with positive skew. The pattern variance in\nthe right tails is particularly revealing of disequilibrium\nfluctuations in the Tiebout sorting process. Fatter right tails with\npositive skew, we believe, might constitute a strong signal of\ninter-jurisdictional sorting in the Tiebout sense.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/empirical_dists\/empdist_0016.png}\n\\caption{\\label{mdistx}Marginal distribution of x (in thousands) for the period $2000-2016$.

The stacked histograms reveal the time invariance of the statistical equilibrium distributions for the different years that make up the pooled sample.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA visual inspection of these distributions points to the asymmetric\nSubbotin or exponential power distribution \\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012} as a potential candidate for modeling the statistical\nequilibrium density and for approximating the empirical frequencies of\nschool district educational returns in the period considered\n\\citep{fruhwirth-schnatter_mixture_2015}>.\n\nWhile these may be good candidates for characterizing highly skewed and\npeaked distributions, in general, their specifications would not allows us to draw\nstraightforward theoretical conclusions from estimates of their\nlocation, scale and shape parameters. In sections 4 and 5, we show how\nthe maximum entropy derivation of the QRSE model leads to a marginal\ndensity function $\\hat{f}_{x}$ whose parameter estimates can be\ndirectly linked to the impact of competition and households incentives\non jurisdictional sorting and expenditure levels.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Free Competition and The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3}\n\n\\subsection{Smith's Theory of Competition}\n\\label{sec-3-1}\n\nIn the classical Smithian theory of competition, profit-seeking agents\nmake the choice to enter or exit lines of production based on the\nmarket's prevailing rate of return. Unlike general equilibrium models,\nwhere prices and rates of return are understood as static market\nclearing quantities in a pure exchange economy, competitive price and\nrate discovery in the Smithian conception follows a process governed\nby negative feedbacks. As producers enter profitable lines of\nproduction they tend to lower the profit rate by crowding the output\nand supply of that particular good. Eventually, this forces relocation\nof capital and resources into other sectors, pushing the rate back to\nattractive levels\n\\citep{smith_wealth_1937,schafol,shaikh_capitalism_2016}.\n\nThis homeostatic process, in which rates are pushed up and down as\nresources enter and relocate throughout sectors in the economy, has\nthe particular advantage that it lends itself well to a probabilistic\ninterpretation \\citep{farjoun_laws_2020}. Observed prices and\nreturns can be effectively seen as gravitating around a fundamental\ncentral tendency. If we think in terms of probability distributions,\nwe may suitably express a rate's theoretical fundamental value or its\n'natural' (regulating) level as the distribution's location\nparameter. Similarly, the extent to which observed rates vary and the\nintensity with which they respond to exit and entry decisions may be\nsuitably captured by variance and scale parameters.\n\nIn this paper we seek to link this theory of free competition to\nTiebout's original account of the role that inter-jurisdictional\ncompetition plays in determining equilibrium levels for local fiscal\nand expenditure variables, as well as for household choice.  Our\nproposition departs radically from the education finance literature in\nthat we propose a statistical understanding of equilibrium, and do not\nfollow the requirement that parameter estimates be interpreted as\noperating at fully efficient margins. This leaves open the possibility\nthat households' expectations and preferences might remain unfulfilled\nin equilibrium. But because the equilibrium is statistical, and not\nstatic, this does not constitute a barrier for analysis. The framework\nconsidered here allows us to study how such departures from optimality\nand efficiency may relate to the distinct statistical features of\nexpenditure levels in decentralized education markets, such as\npositive skew and sharp pre-modal decay. \n\n\\subsection{The Tiebout Hypothesis}\n\\label{sec-3-2}\n\nIn his 1956 paper, Tiebout laid out a set of highly abstract\nassumptions for his model of local public goods competition, which he\nalso called \"a pure theory of local expenditures\". The model's\nassumptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consumer-voters have full mobility and knowledge of prevailing\nexpenditure patterns in neighboring communities.  \\item Mobility is a\nproxy for consumer-voter choice.  \\item There is a large number of\ncommunities from which to choose.  \\item There is an optimal community\nsize, given demand conditions and fixed resources.  \\item Tax-service\npackages are set according to consumer-voter preferences.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\nGiven that Tiebout's model postulates consumer-voters as choosing\ntax-service packages by moving in and out of communities, and that the\nlevels of these public goods packages are determined by local\ngovernments in response to demand (i.e migration inflows and\noutflows), we can see how the Smithian framework applies. In the\ncontext of education expenditures, we assume that inhabitants are\nlooking for high rates of return to their decision to locate or\nrelocate to a particular community. We take these rates of return to\nbe proportional to the difference between the \\emph{per capita local tax\nrate} and \\emph{per pupil local expenditures} that consumer-voters face in\nthe local public goods market.  For the purposes of this paper, we\ntake these market units to be school districts. Competitive school\ndistricts will offer attractive per pupil expenditure rates, and low\nper capita tax rates and service charges.  As consumer-voters crowd\ndistricts with good schools and low taxes, the rates of educational\nreturns return will adjust accordingly, and under the assumptions of\nfull mobility and rational incentives to fulfill expectations in a\nlocal public goods payoff, the iterative process of rate adjustment\nand migration flows will stabilize expenditures into the observed\npatterns.\n\n\nThe outcome variable $x$, the \\emph{per pupil rate of return on local tax\nspending and charges}, which we termed \\textbf{educational returns} is\ndefined by the difference:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{x = \\kappa - \\tau } \\]\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the total local expenditure per pupil, scaled by the\nschool district's enrollment, and $\\tau$ the total local tax and\ncharge burden, scaled by the district's population. In the next\nsection we delve deeper into our statistical treatment of Tiebout\ncompetition and derive the QRSE density $\\hat{f}_{x}$.\n\n\n\\section{Local Public School Expenditures and Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4}\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Equilibrium Modeling and Maximum Entropy Inference}\n\\label{sec-4-1}\n\nThe highly peaked and positively skewed patterns of the outcome\nvariable $x$ for the 2000-2016 period suggests the existence of a\ncentral tendency in the distribution along with non-symmetric\ndeviations from its mean. Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions\n(AEPD) and Skewed Exponential Power Distributions (SEPD)\n\\citep{alfarano_statistical_2012,schafsim,mundt_asymmetric_2019}\nare good candidates to model this kind of data. But because we need a\nconstructive probabilistic description that is phenomenologically\nrelevant, as well as theoretically interpretable in its parameters, we\nimplement a Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium\n(QRSE) model to fit this data.\n\nThe notion of statistical equilibrium has been widely used in physics\nand information theory\n\\citep{jaynes_concentration_1983,jaynes_information_1957}. A\nstatistical equilibrium for a quantity $x$ takes the form of a\nprobability density function $f_{x}$; it represents the most likely\ndistribution for the outcome variable given a set of theoretical and\nempirical conditions. It can be derived by maximizing the entropy\n$H[f_{x}] = - \\sum \\limits_{x} f_{x} \\, log[f_{x}]$ subject to\nconstraints expressing relevant information, theory or\nobservations. The methodology is most commonly used in the context of\nbayesian statistics with the purpose of deriving informative priors by\nfeeding moment constraints and relevant background information to the\nmaximum entropy program. An important feature of the maximum entropy\nprogram is that as long as the set of constraints provided describe a\nnon-empty convex set in the space of distributions, the maximum\nentropy program will yield an optimal solution that can be used as the\nstatistical equilibrium density of the model\n\\citep{schafol,golan_foundations}. For more details on the\nderivation of maximum entropy distributions see\n\\citep{sivia_data_2006,jaynes_probability_2003,golan_foundations}.\n\nWe can view single-state solutions to general equilibrium models as\nspecial cases of this statistical equilibrium model. They represent\ndegenerate probability densities for the variable $x$ where only the\noptimal solution is assigned a positive probability. Such degenerate\ndistributions, with all the probability mass concentrated around a\nsingle point, also imply systems that operate with zero\nentropy. \n\nFormally, the model we present here is a derived maximum\nentropy distribution for the joint density of household jurisdictional\nchoice and educational returns $x$. Rather than giving full\nstatistical content to the complete set of assumptions in the Tiebout\nhypothesis, we use this derived probability model to examine Tiebout's\nintuition regarding the role of competition and household\nchoice in shaping the marginal distribution $f_{x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Logit Quantal Response Function for Household Choice}\n\\label{sec-4-2}\n\nThe general Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) model\npresented here links a set of household quantal actions $a \\in\n\\mathcal{A}$ to the outcome variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This could\nalso be a vector $\\vec{x}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but in this paper the\nvariable $x$ is a scalar, which corresponds to the level of\neducational returns at the school district level. $\\mathcal{A}$ is be\nthe binary action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{e, s \\}$ \u2014where $e$ stands for the\n\\emph{entry} of households into a particular school district, and $s$ for\nthe \\emph{exit}. The interaction between the hidden quantal action set\n$\\mathcal{A}$ and the outcome variable $x$ is modeled by the joint\ndistribution $f_{x,a}$.  The maximum entropy distribution $f_{x,a}$\nrepresents a statistical equilibrium where the inflow\/outflow actions\nof households, represented by the set $\\mathcal{A}$, are conditionally\ndependent on the educational returns rate $x$, but also shape it via\nequilibrating forces and the negative feedback process which we\ndefined as Smithian and Tiebout-like competition. We define the payoff for the typical household by the function \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{payoff} \n\\pi(a, x): \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe payoff takes as input an action from the action set $\\mathcal{A}$,\nand a signal from the state space of educational returns $x \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$.  We use linear symmetric payoffs such that $\\pi(e,x) =\n-\\pi(s,x)$, as shown in equation \\ref{pstruct}. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{pstruct}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(e,x) = x -\\mu \\\\\n\\pi(s,x) = \\mu - x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe difference of the entry and exit payoffs is given by equation\n\\ref{paydiff} below:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{paydiff}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x) &= \\\\\n&= \\pi(e,x)  - \\pi(s,x) \\\\\n&= 2(x-\\mu) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis payoff structure contains a location parameter $\\mu$ to express\nthe fact that households will have a tipping point for moving in or\nout of a particular school district. Households will tend to move into\ndistricts where the level of educational returns is above this\nexpectation $\\mu$ and vice versa.  Note that $\\mu$ is not the average\nrate, but the expectation that the households forms prior to relocation.\n\n\nThe first constraint that we impose on our statistical model of local\neducation returns is that it be micro-founded by a probabilistic\ntheory of behavior. In other words, we expect the entry and exit\ndecisions of households to be non-deterministic responses to\nvariations in local expenditure patterns for the set of communities\nthat constitute the local public goods market. It is possible to think\nof this as the assumption that households follow `mixed strategies' in\ndetermining whether to move in or out of a particular district. At\ntimes they will follow their payoff maximizing action, but sometimes\nthey won't. We expect the probabilities of observing a particular\nbehavior to be proportional to the payoffs in equation \\ref{pstruct},\nand exclude the degenerate case in which households choose only the\npayoff maximizing action with probability $1$.\n\nOne way to derive the stochastic function which describes the\nmicro-level behavioral component of the model is to impose a minimum\nentropy constraint on the utility maximization program of the\nagent. The household payoff maximization program and the associated\nLagrangian take the forms shown below in equations \\ref{maxent1} and\n\\ref{lag1}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\underset{f_{a| x}\\geq 0}{\\max} \\space \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x) \\\\ &\\text { s.t: } \\\\ & \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}=1\n\\\\ &-\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}] \\geq \\space\nH_{\\operatorname{min}} \\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag1}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}=-& \\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x}-1\\right)\n\\\\ &+T\\left(\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} f_{a \\mid x} \\log [f_{a \\mid x}]-H_{\\min }\\right)\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis maximization program introduces the behavioral parameter of the\nmodel $T$. In \\citet{schafol} it is described as a `behavior\ntemperature' parameter in analogy to statistical models of\nthermodynamic systems, but it can also be understood as a bounded\nrationality constraint.  Maximizing the payoff subject to a minimum\nentropy constraint is dual to the problem of maximizing the entropy of\nthe mixed strategy $f_{a|x}$ subject to a minimum payoff\nconstraint. In that dual case, the Lagrangian containts the term\n$\\beta\\left(\\sum_{a} f_{a \\mid x} \\space\n\\pi(a,x)-U_{\\operatorname{min}}\\right)$, which links the multiplier\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{T}$ to the minimum payoff constraint.  \n\nThe solution to this programming problem yields a general logit\nquantal response or Gibbs density, as in equation \\ref{gibbs_micro}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{gibbs_micro}\nf_{a \\mid x}=\\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\pi(a, x)}{T}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nFor the case of the binary action set $\\mathcal{A}$, the program\nyields the canonical QRSE logit quantal response functions in \\ref{qr1}\nand \\ref{qr2}. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr1}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{e \\mid x} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{\\pi}(a, x)}{T}}}  = \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qr2}\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{s \\mid x}=1-f_{e \\mid x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThis pair of stochastic quantal response functions take the shape of\nthe cumulative distribution function for the logistic\ndistribution. The parameter $T$ is the scale parameter that expresses\nthe sensitivity of the household choice rule to the difference in the\nobserved outcome from the subjective expectation ($x-\\mu$). The\nintroduction of $\\mu$ allows us to model household behavior as\n'chasing' a central tendency in the outcome variable $x$, and as\nhaving a `tipping point' for the choice to enter or exit a particular\nschool district. In the context of Tiebout competition, these\nstochastic choice rules should be conceived as representing\nconditional probabilities for migration inflow or outflow into the\nensemble of school districts for which the parameter $T$ is\nestimated. They are not `agent-level' functions that additively\naggregate to the ensemble equilibrium distribution, but rather a\n\\emph{meso-level} description that models the dependency of entry\/exit\nflows on observed expenditure patterns and local fiscal variables.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/sdflows.png}\n\\caption{\\label{qexample}Quantal responses functions for probability of household entry\/exit. At near zero $T$ the quantal response function takes resembles the heaviside step function. Under a zero entropy assumption $(T=0)$, we would expect households to move into districts exclusively in the case where $x - \\mu  > 0$.  This graph is illustrative (taking $T$=0.1 and $T$ = 3 as examples).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Competitive Feedback Constraint}\n\\label{sec-4-3}\n\nIn the canonical QRSE model from \\citet{schafol} which is applied here,\nagents respond to payoff differentials by entering or exiting a\nparticular economic sector. In the Tiebout setting, household inflows\ninto particular districts may cause congestion in public school\nservices and lead to a feedback effect where the level of educational\nreturns $x$ will be reduced. Conversely, household outflows from\nschool districts will tend (over time) to push the educational returns\nrate back up. In the QRSE model, this assumption takes the form of a\ncongestion or `competitive feedback' constraint on the outcome\ndistribution. The competitive feedback constraint is expressed as an\ninequality that limits the scale of the difference between expected market\nrates conditional on entry and exit, as shown in \\ref{fbconst}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst}\n0 \\leq f_{e} \\: \\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) |e ]-f_{s}\\:\\mathrm{E}[(x-\\alpha) | s] \\leq \\epsilon\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nThis inequality expresses the idea that the expected jurisdictional\nmarket rates will be higher conditional on entry than on exit\u2014\u2014but\nthat their difference is small enough so that we wouldn't expect an\ninfinite inflow or crowding into a particular district. This\nconstraint allows us to parsimoniously model the simultaneous and\nfeedback driven relationship that exists between household choice and\nexpenditure levels in the local education market.\n\nThe mean outcome level $\\bar{x}$ is then co-determined by a complex (non-reductive)\ninteraction between those two layers of the economic\nprocess. In practice we tend to find that $\\alpha \\neq \\mu$, which means that\nthe market sustains unexpected outcomes and unfulfilled expectations,\nan assumption that seems appropriate for the case of public goods markets. The constraint in \\ref{fbconst} can be unpacked in more detail using\nthe form in equation \\ref{fbconst2}, where it is written as an\nexpectation of the market outcome $(x-\\alpha)$, factored by the\ndifference in mixed strategy probabilities $\\Delta \\; f_{a|x}$:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst2} \n\\begin{aligned}\n&f_{e}\\int f_{x|e}\\:(x-\\alpha) \\: dx - f_{s}\\int f_{x|s} \\: (x-\\alpha) \\: dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int f_{e|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx - \\int f_{s|x}\\:f_{x}\\;(x-\\alpha) dx\\\\\n&\\\\\n&= \\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\: f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \n&\\\\\n&=  \\int \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right) f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\space \\; dx \\\\\n& \\leq \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tanh}$ function arises from the definition of the\nlogit quantal response functions, as shown below in \\ref{tanhd}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tanhd}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta f_{a|x} = f_{e|x} - f_{s|x} \\\\\n&\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{T}}}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}-1}{e^{2(x-\\mu)\/T}+1}\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\n&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nThus, the competitive feedback constraint can be written using the general form written in\n\\ref{fbconst3}, noting that $\\Delta f_{a|x} = \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)$: \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{fbconst3}\n\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next subsection we explain how the assumptions of entropy constrained behavior and the\nexistence of a competitive feedback constraint determine, via the maximum\nentropy program, the joint distribution $f_{a,x}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{QRSE Maximum Entropy Program and Density}\n\\label{sec-4-4}\n\nThe maximum entropy program for the QRSE model constrains the joint\ndistribution $f_{a,x}$ so that it is consistent with the following two\npropositions:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The behavioral property of a non-zero entropy rule for household\njurisdictional choice (entry\/exit decisions).  \\item The competitive\nfeedback constraint that we postulate for the Tiebout-like process in\nanalogy with the Smithian theory of competition.  \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\medskip\n\nThese conditions were formally defined in the previous two\nsubsections. We also constraint the distribution so that it meets the\nusual normalization condition: $\\int f_{x} dx=1$. Hence, the\nprogram maximizes the joint entropy of $f_{a,x}$ subject to\nnormalization, competitive feedback, and bounded household\nchoice constraints. We can express the joint entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x.a}$\nin terms of the marginal entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{x}$ and the conditional or\n'binary entropy'  $\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}$  \\citep{cover2006elements},\nas shown in \\ref{jointh} and \\ref{binaryh}. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{jointh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{x.a} = \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{binaryh}\n\\operatorname{H}_{a|x}= - \\sum\\limits_{\\mathcal{A}}\\; f_{a|x} \\; \\operatorname{log} [f_{a|x}]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nUsing the above decomposition, we can write the\nmaximization program for the QRSE model using the compact form shown\nbelow in equation \\ref{maxent2}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{maxent2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{f_{x} \\geq 0} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx\\\\ \n&\\text { st. } \\\\ \n& \\int f_{x} \\; dx \\; =1 \\\\\n&\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; \\leq \\; \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nNote that the second constraint parsimoniously encodes both the\nbehavioral and the market feedback constraints. The associated\nLagrangian takes the form in equation \\ref{lag2} below:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{lag2}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}[f_{x}, \\lambda, \\gamma]=& \\:\\operatorname{H}_{x}  + \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{X}}f_{x} \\; \\operatorname{H}_{a|x} \\; dx \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\lambda\\left(\\int f_{x} d x-1\\right) \\\\\n&\\\\\n&-\\gamma\\left(\\int \\Delta f_{a|x} \\; f_{x} \\; (x-\\alpha) \\; dx \\; - \\; \\epsilon\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe multiplier associated to the competitive feedback constraint in the program\nyields the $\\gamma$ parameter for the candidate statistical\nequilibrium density, which measures the effect of the competitive\nfeedback process on the marginal distribution $f_{x}$. \n\nThe solution to this maximum entropy program produces a predictive\ndensity $\\hat{f}_{x}$ that is consistent with our \ndescription of Tiebout-like competition in local public goods\nmarkets. The distribution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ predicts the marginal\nfrequencies of the outcome variable $x$ and completes the theory by\ndetermining the conditional densities $f_{x|e}$ and $f_{x|s}$, the\njoint densitiy $f_{x,a}$, a well as the expectations $E[x|s]$ and\n$E[x|e]$.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThe solution $\\hat{f}_{x}$ takes the form of a Gibbs\/Boltzmann\ndistribution, shown below in equation \\ref{qkernel0}:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel0}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the partition function.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partfunc}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\gamma\\left(\\Delta f_{a|x}\\right)\\;(x-\\alpha)}\\; \\operatorname{dx}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip\n\nBy expressing the $\\gamma$ parameter as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{S}$, we can\nrewrite the predictive marginal density $\\hat{f}_{x}$ as below in\n\\ref{qkernel}:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{qkernel}\n\\hat{f}_{x}= \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}}{\\mathrm{Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\medskip \n\nWith this parametrization it is then possible to perform inference\nusing two scale parameters $T$ and $S$, and two location parameters\n$\\mu$ and $\\alpha$, which all have the same dimension as the\neducational returns variable $x$. The scale parameter $S$ accounts for\nthe concentration of educational returns around the mode that arises from the\nmarket level process of jurisdictional competition, while the scale\nparameter $T$ accounts for the concentration of values that arises\nfrom the purposive behavior of households.\n\n\\medskip \n\nIn the next section we provide details on the bayesian estimation of\nthe model for the pooled dataset using all US school districts in the\nperiod 2000-2016, and focus our discussion on theoretically\ninterpretable results for the four unknown parameters $T$, $\\mu$, $S$\nand $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\\section{Bayesian Estimation of QRSE Model}\n\\label{sec-5}\n\n\\subsection{MAPs and Distance Measures}\n\\label{sec-5-1}\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to recover the values for the unknown\nparameter vector $\\Gamma = [T, S, \\mu, \\alpha]$, for the full sample\ncontaining all US school districts in the 2000-2016 period. The\napproach we followed in our estimation procedure was to first find\nclose to optimal values for the model by jointly minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the observed marginal\nfrequency $\\bar{f}_{x}$ and the inferred theoretical frequency\n$\\hat{f}_{x}$. This is equivalent to finding maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) point estimates for $\\Gamma$, given that maximizing the\nlikelihood turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the KL-Divergence\n(See \\citet{golan_foundations}) . To find these MAPs we used the\navailable optimization packages found in the Python Scipy library\n(COBYLA and SLSQP). Minimizing the functional in equation \\ref{klfunc}\nyields the MAPs that we then use as starting points for the MCMC\nsampler.\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{klfunc} D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\|\n\\bar{f}_{x} \\right)=\\sum \\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x} \\log\n\\left[\\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\Gamma;x}}{\\bar{f}_{x}}\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\nAdditionally, we use the Soofi information distinguishability\nstatistic (Soofi ID; See \\citet{soofi_information_2002} for details and\ntheory) to evaluate fit performance. The Soofi ID is shown below in\nequation \\ref{soofiq}. Smaller values of the KL-Divergence and of the\nSoofi ID imply better model fits and the Soofi ID in particular gives\na measure of how much informational content is explained (recovered)\nby the candidate distribution.\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{soofiq} I D\\left(\\hat{f}_{x}: \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)=1-\\exp \\left[-D_{K L}\\left(\\hat{f}_{x} \\| \\bar{f}_{x}\n\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\n\n\\medskip \n\n\n\\subsection{Model Specification and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling}\n\\label{sec-5-2}\n\nWe use the QRSE density itself as the likelihood for estimation,\nconsidering that the sampler holds the data $D$ fixed as it explores\ndifferent probabilities for the parameters in $\\Gamma$ via\n$P(D|\\Gamma)$. Alternatively, to justify this, one might simply note\nthat the likelihood is proportional to the sampling distribution ;\n$L(\\Gamma \\mid x) \\propto f_{x \\mid \\Gamma}$. The QRSE log-likelihood used for the sampler is shown below in\n\\ref{loglike}:\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{loglike} \\operatorname{log}[\\hat{f}_{x}] = \\;\n\\operatorname{H_{a|x}} -\\; \\operatorname{tanh}\\left(\n\\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right) -\n\\operatorname{log}\\left(\\mathrm{Z}\\right) \\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\n\nWe directly compute the partition function $\\mathrm{Z}$ by the sum in \\ref{partsum}. \n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{partsum}\n\\mathrm{Z} = \\sum \\limits_{\\mathcal{X}} e^{\\operatorname{H_{a|x}}}\\;e^{-\\operatorname{tanh}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{T}\\right)\\;\\left(\\frac{x-\\alpha}{S}\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\medskip \n\nWe evaluate the log-likelihood in \\ref{loglike} by computing sequences\nof random samples from the joint posterior distribution of\n$\\Gamma$. In this paper we use a standard Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm (MCMC-MH; see \\citet{hogg2018data}).  Our code uses PyMC3 \\citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2015}, an open source probabilistic programming\nframework written in Python \\footnote{Code used, data and MCMC\nsample traces will be made available in a\npublic GitHub repository for review. For details on the PyMC3 library\nsee: \\url{https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/api\/inference.html}}. \n\n\\medskip \n\nFor each parameter, we run 3 chains with $30,000$ iterations and\n$4,000$ tuning samples. All of the chains converged with $\\hat{R}\n=1$. For more details on the convergence statistic $\\hat{R}$ used see\n\\citet{vehtari2019rank}. We show a plot of the chain sample\ntraces below in figure \\ref{mctrace}. In figure \\ref{pairplot} we show\npair plots of the posterior samples for the four parameters, which do\nnot appear to be correlated. We used truncated normal priors centered\nnear the MAP estimates for T and S, with lower and upper bounds at\n$0.1$ and $8$ respectively. For $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ we used normal\npriors centered near the MAPs and specified large variances in order\nto explore reasonably wide ranges of the parameter space.

To do so we implemented a quantal response\nstatistical equilibrium (QRSE) model, which allowed us to characterize\ncompetition between local jurisdictions as a complex negative feedback\nprocess operating at both the household-level and market-level\nscales. The QRSE model used in this paper parsimoniously characterizes\nthe complex interaction between household jurisdictional choice and\nthe emergent statistical properties of decentralized education markets\nin terms of the parameter vector $\\Gamma = [T,S, \\mu, \\alpha]$. The\nobserved distribution of educational returns is then explained via the\npredictive distribution $\\hat{f}_{x; \\Gamma}$. In order to better understand the distinct role that both the scale (S\n\\& T) and location ($\\mu$ and $\\alpha$) parameters play in explaining\nobserved patterns, it is useful to plot variations to the individual\nparameters holding all others constant. We do so below in figure\n\\ref{thplots}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphs\/discussion\/qtheory.png}\n\\caption{\\label{thplots}Variations to individual parameter, holding all others constant. The baseline setting is T = 5, S=5, and $\\mu$ = $\\alpha$ = 0.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ parameters are particularly relevant in understanding the positive\nskewness of the statistical equilibrium distribution that we find for\nthe full ensemble case. The parameter $\\alpha$ estimates a market-level\nstatistical tendency that acts as the barycenter around which the\nhousehold-formed expectation $\\mu$ fluctuates. To see how this is\nbuilt into the theory, note that in the competitive feedback\nconstraint in \\ref{fbconst}, we write the expectation as $E[x-\\alpha]$\nand not $E[x]$. In the case where households' expectations of the\nlocal educational returns rate matches the market level tendency, then\n$\\alpha = \\mu$. In that case the distribution is symmetrical and the\nestimated values for $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ also match the sample mean\n$\\bar{x}$. Whenever $\\mu \\neq \\alpha$, then the QRSE distribution is\nasymmetrical, and positive values for $\\alpha - \\mu$ in particular\nwill lend the distribution a more or less sizeable positive skew.\nAs shown in figure \\ref{thplots}, both the behavioral and market scale\nparameters T and S predict a lesser\/larger concentration of values\naround the mode, with lower values lending more peakedness to the\ndistribution. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThe QRSE model explains concentration around modal values as\nthe consequence of intense competition in decentralized public\neducation markets. Both relatively purposive households and market\nfeedbacks work to stabilize educational returns into their statistical\nequilibrium distribution. This understanding of competition is consistent with the profit rate\nequalization hypothesis that one finds in classical political economy,\nand which has been given modern statistical treatments in\n\\citep{farjoun_laws_2020,schafsim,alfarano_statistical_2012,schafol}.\n\n\\medskip \n\nThe statistical equilibrium analysis shows concrete evidence  that there are both\nsorting forces and competitive forces at play in determining the equilibrium \neducational returns rate. Tiebout sorting in particular educational markets might \nin fact be signaled by distributions with heavy right tails and positive skew. We believe\nthis to be the case in the sense that `better sorted' or more\n'balanced' subsamples in $x$ will undoubtedly contain a broader set of\ntax-service packages that households sort into via the local public\ngoods and housing markets. In our QRSE model and estimates, the Tiebout `sorting forces' are\ncaptured by the size of the difference $\\alpha - \\mu$, while the\ncompetitive forces are captured by the size and interaction of the $T$\nand $S$ parameters. This leads to future work needing to unpack how\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter is related to median household\nincome and property values in school districts, given that high income\nand property values push public school expenditures far beyond\ncompetitive or modal rates. \n\n\nEducational returns in school districts across the US for the\n2000-2016 period exhibit distinctively peaked, positively skewed\ndistributions with right tails of variable width. The shaping of their\nstatistical equilibrium distribution is the outcome of an evolving\nprocess of inter-jurisdictional competition, household residential\nsorting on the basis of a broad set of characteristics (such as\nincome), and shifting policy regimes at the local, state and federal\nlevels.\n\n\\medskip \n\nUsing a statistical equilibrium framework, in this paper we sought to\nexamine the role played by inter-jurisdictional competition and\nhousehold choice in shaping the observed distribution of educational\nreturns for a full ensemble case that covers all US school districts\nin the 2000-2016 period. This is a considerably larger sample than the\nones found in other empirical treatments in the literature, which\nusually focus on single states or regions. An\nimportant aspect of our empirical findings is that it corroborates the\nneed to divorce normative notions about market efficiency from claims about the presence of Tiebout sorting and competition. We proposed a parsimonious model that\nmeaningfully captures the difference between competitive and sorting\nforces via two sets of scale and location parameters. \n\n\\medskip \n\n\nThis empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the QRSE\nliterature regarding the use of feedback constraints as\nmeaningful characterizations of competition in decentralized market\nsettings. The histogram and model fit displayed in this paper are\nclearly suggestive of the part played by decentralized competition in\nsharpening modal peaks, and by elevated (far from competitive) market\nrates in creating positive skew.\n\n\\newpage \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}\n\\bibliography{references}  \n\n\\end{document}","rating_answer":"1.
