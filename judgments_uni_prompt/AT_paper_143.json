In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}).

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

$a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) )^{hC_p} $\n    and use the fact that the underlying (non-equivariant) map of $a_\\lambda$ is nullhomotopic\n    to conclude that $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X) = 0$.\n    The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete, then $X$ satisfies the Segal conjecture for $C_p$. \n    That is, the canonical map \n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\] \n    is an isomorphism, where the Tate construction is with respect to trivial action.\n\\end{thm}\n \n\\begin{proof}\n    The formula for the Tate construction from \\Cref{tatelimit}\n    together with

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma

$K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W.

Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we

(\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.     Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal of the Steenrod algebra. \n    We say the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete if \n    $H_{*}(X) \\cong \\varprojlim_{n} H_{*}(X)\/I^{n}$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIn order to explain our proof of \\Cref{segalconjIcmpl} it will be useful to review the method used by Lin to prove \\Cref{linmainthm} in \\cite{lin1980conjectures}.\nThe key step is showing that it in fact suffices to prove that the canonical map induces an isomorphism on the level of the $E_2$-page of an appropriate Adams spectral sequence. The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ?

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and

$\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is

In his thesis \\cite{yuan2021integral}, Yuan proves that the canonical map is an isomorphism for a $p$-completion of an (infinite) sum of spheres $\\left( \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\bb{S} \\right)_{p}$. Our main theorem extends the collection of $X$ for which this question has a positive answer to include many more examples of bounded below infinite spectra. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\begin{thm} [Theorem~\\ref{segalconjIcmpl}]\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum.\n    If the homology of $X$ is $I$-complete (in the sense defined below), then the canonical map\n    \\[ X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p} \\]\n    is an isomorphism.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnInilpotent}\n    Given a spectrum $X$, the $\\bb{F}_p$-homology naturally carries an an action of the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\\mc{A}$.

The subtle point here is that when taking the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{BC_p}$ it is important to first filter $BC_p$ by finite skeleta $P^k$, then take the Adams spectral sequence of $\\bb{S}^{P^k}$ and then and only then pass to the inverse limit over $k$  at the level of Adams spectral sequences. The catch is that one must make good sense out of the phrase \"limit of spectral sequences\". Lin implemented this in \\cite{lin1980conjectures} in an ad-hoc way, specialized to the problem at hand.\nThe isomorphism of $E_2$-pages then comes from the ext calculations of \\cite{lin1980calculation}.\n\nIn this article, we revisit Lin's constructions within the context of synthetic spectra\nas a natural home for \"limits of synthetic spectra\". The upshot of this is that it is now straightforward to prove a reduction to an $E_2$-page calculation for any bounded below $X$. \nAfter some further categorical manipulations we find that $I$-completeness is enough to reduce the necessary ext calculation to the cases already handled in \\cite{lin1980calculation} and \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\nThe conjecture was answered to be true by a sequence of progress, for $G = \\bb{Z}\/2$ by W. H. Lin \\cite{lin1980conjectures}, for $G = C_p$  for odd primes by J. H. Gunawardena \\cite{gunawardena1980segal}, for elementary abelian groups by J. F. Adams, J. H. \nGunawardena, H. Miller \\cite{adams1974stable} and G. Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1983gb} and finally for all groups by G.Carlsson \\cite{carlsson1984equivariant}.\n\nThere is a spectrum-level statement of the above statement. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ be the category of genuine equivariant spectra, with unit object $\\bb{S}_{G}$ the $G$-equivariant sphere. Then the Segal conjecture can be stated as the comparison map:\n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$\nis an isomorphism after $p$-completion.\n\nLet $G  = C_p$, for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}_{G}$ we have the Tate pullback square:\n\\[\\begin{tikzcd}\n\t{X^{C_p}} & {\\Phi^{C_p}(X)} \\\\\n\t{X^{hC_p}} & {X^{tC_p}}\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]\n\t\\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]\n\t\\arrow[\"\\lrcorner\"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}\\]\nThis implies to get the isomorphism \n$$(\\bb{S}_{G})^{G} \\rightarrow (\\bb{S}_{G})^{hG}$$ \nif and only if \n$$\\Phi^{C_p}(\\bb{S}_G)  \\cong \\bb{S} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$$\nis an isomorphism after p-completion.\n\n\\begin{thm} \\cite{lin1980conjectures, gunawardena1980segal} \\label{linmainthm}\n    The natural map $\\bb{S}^{\\wedge}_{p} \\to \\bb{S}^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism.\n    \\qed\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe have the inflation functor $i: \\rm{Sp} \\rightarrow \\rm{Sp}_{G}$, which is a symmetric monoidal functor and a left adjoint. Using this, any spectrum $X$ can be seen as genuine $G$-spectrum whose underlying Borel spectrum $X$ with a trivial action of $G$.\n\nSince $i$ is symmetric monoidal we have $i(\\bb{S}) = \\bb{S}_{G}$ and since $i$ is also a left adjoint for any $X \\in \\rm{Sp}, \\ i(X) = i(\\bb{S}) \\otimes X$\\footnote{Which makes sense, since $\\rm{Sp}_{G}$ is a stable, presentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, so we can tensor with respect any object $X \\in \\rm{Sp}$}. \n\nWe can then ask the following question:\n\n\\begin{ques} \\label{segalques}\n    For a spectrum $X$ and $G = C_p$, is the map $i(X)^{G} \\rightarrow i(X)^{hG}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion ? or equivalently, is the map $X \\rightarrow X^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion, where the underlying action on the spectrum is trivial?.\n\\end{ques}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    By Theorem \\ref{linmainthm} and observing both $p$-completion and Tate construction are exact, we can say the answer to \\ref{segalques} is true if $X$ is a finite spectrum.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn this note, we extend this result beyond finite spectra and give some examples of non-finite spectra that satisfy the version of the Segal conjecture mentioned above.\n\n    \n\\end{comment}\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    There are many examples where the canonical map is not an isomorphism.\n    For example, \n    $\\F_p^{tC_p}$ is unbounded (while $\\F_p$ itself is bounded) and\n    $(\\mathrm{KU}_p)^{tC_p}$ is a $\\bb{Q}$-module (while $\\mathrm{KU}^{\\wedge}_{p}$ is not rational). \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n    In the unstable setting Miller proved the Sullivan conjecture, that for a finite space $X$ with a trivial $C_p$ action, the map $X \\rightarrow X^{hC_p}$ is an isomorphism after $p$-completion \\cite{miller1984sullivan}.\n    Extending this Lannes and Schwartz proved the same result with the weaker hypothesis that the cohomology of $X$ is locally finite \\cite{lannes1986conjectures}. \n    It was this extension of the Sullivan conjecture to non-finite spaces that motivated us to look for a corresponding extension of the Segal conjecture to non-finite spectra.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nIn \\Cref{sec:syn} we briefly review the theory of synthetic spectra which we will be using.\nIn \\Cref{sec:main} we prove our main theorem.\nFinally, in \\Cref{examples} we give several examples of non-finite $I$-complete spectra.\nA example of note is $\\Sigma_+^\\infty X$ where $X$ is a space whose cohomology is finite type and locally finite (see Definition \\ref{defnlocallyfinite}). \n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jesper Grodal, Haynes Miller and Zhouli Xu for helpful conversations related to the contents of this paper.\nThe authors would further like to thank Tobias Bartel, Natalia Castellena, Jesper Grodal, Branko Juran and Jesper Michael M{\\o}ller for useful comments on a draft.\n\nDuring the course of this work the authors were supported by the DNRF through the Copenhagen center for Geometry and Topology (DNRF151).\nIn addition, the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-2202992. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Synthetic Spectra and the Adams spectral sequence} \\label{sec:syn}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief refresher on the Adams spectral sequence and synthetic spectra.\nOur aim is to set the stage for the final section; our exposition will be terse. \n\n\n\\begin{defn}     Let $E$ be homotopy associative ring spectrum.\n    \n    A finite spectrum $X$ is said to be \\emph{finite $E$-projective} if $E_{*}X$ is a finitely generated, projective module over the graded ring $E_{*}$.\n    \n    We say that $E$ is \\emph{of Adams-type}, \n    if $E$ can be written as a filtered colimit $E \\cong \\varinjlim E_{\\alpha}$, where each $E_{\\alpha}$ is finite $E$-projective and the $E$-cohomology of each $E_{\\alpha}$ is dual to its homology, i.e. \n    $$ E^{*}E_{\\alpha} \\cong \\rm{Hom}_{E_{*}}(E_{*}E_{\\alpha}, E_{*}).\\hfill\\qedhere $$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Examples of Adams-type ring spectra include:\n    $\\bb{Q}$, \n    $\\bb{F}_p$,\n    the $p$-adic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU_p$,\n    the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, \n    any Landweber exact cohomology theory and\n    the Morava $K$-theories $K(n)$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nGiven an Adams-type ring spectrum $E$, Adams constructed, for each pair of spectra $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{Sp}$ with $X$ finite $E$-projective, a spectral sequence of signature\n$$ \\rm{Ext}^{s,t}_{E_{*}E}(E_{*}X,E_{*}Y) \\cong E^{2}_{s,t} \\implies \\pi_{t-s}(\\rm{map}(X,Y^{\\wedge}_{E}))$$\nwhere the $\\rm{Ext}$ groups are calculated in the category of comodules over $E_{*}E$ and $Y^{\\wedge}_{E}$ denotes the $E$-nilpotent completion of the spectrum $Y$ \\cite{adams1974stable}.  \n\n\\begin{ex}\n    In the case $E=\\bb{F}_p$ \n    we may identify ${\\modp}_{*}\\modp$ with the mod-$p$ dual Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal{A}^{\\vee}_{p}$.    \n\\end{ex}\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Adams' work Pstr\\k{a}gowski attached to each Adams-type ring spectrum $E$ a category $\\syn{E}$ of $E$-synthetic spectra \ncategorifying the $E$-based Adams spectral sequence.

Using this we form the stable representation spheres $\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\in \\mathrm{Sp}^{BC_p}$ for each $k \\in \\bb{Z}$. The inclusions $k\\lambda \\to (k+1)\\lambda$ provide $C_p$-equivariant maps of representation spheres $a_\\lambda : \\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\to \\bb{S}^{(k+1)\\lambda}$. We define $ P^{\\infty}_{k} \\coloneqq (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda})_{hC_p} $ and write $a_\\lambda$ for the corresponding maps $P^\\infty_k \\to P^\\infty_{k+1}$.\n\\end{cons}\n\nWhen $p=2$ the stunted lens spaces $P_k^\\infty$ coincide with James' stunted projective spaces $\\bb{R}P^\\infty_{2k}$ \\cite{james1959spaces} (cf. \\cite{atiyah1961thom}). The Thom isomorphism lets us compute that the homology of $P_k^\\infty$ is $\\F_p$ in degrees $\\geq 2k$ and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{tatelimit}\n    Using the stunted lens spaces we have an expression for the Tate construction of the trivial action on $X$ as $ \\varprojlim_{k} (X \\otimes \\Sigma P_{k}) $\n    where the limit is along the maps induced by $a_\\lambda$.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We will prove the lemma by examining the cofiber sequence\n    \\[ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} \\to \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p}. \\]\n    First we note that as $X$ has trivial action \n    $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)_{hC_p} \\cong \\varprojlim_k (P_k^\\infty \\otimes X)$.\n    Second we rewrite $\\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{hC_p} $ as\n    $  ( \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda}

  The lemma now follows by noting that the cofiber of $a_\\lambda$ is built out of two free $C_p$-cells and using this to conclude that $(a_\\lambda \\otimes X)^{tC_p}$ is an isomorphism and therefore\n    $ \\varprojlim_k (\\bb{S}^{k\\lambda} \\otimes X)^{tC_p} \\cong X^{tC_p}$.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{segalconjIcmpl}\n    Let $X$ be a $p$-complete, bounded below

prove the theorem by showing that the map\n    \\begin{align} \\nu X \\to \\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\label{eqn:want-iso} \\end{align}\n    is already an isomorphism in $\\syn{\\F_p}$ before inverting $\\tau$.\n\n    Using that $X$ is bounded below and $p$-complete we know from \\Cref{rmktaucompl} \n    that $X$ is also $\\F_p$-nilpotent complete and $\\nu X$ is $\\tau$-complete.\n    Similarly, $X \\otimes \\Sigma P^\\infty_k$ is bounded below and $p$-complete for every $k \\in \\bb{Z}$, therefore\n    $\\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete as well.\n    Since the subcategory of $\\tau$-complete synthetic spectra spectra is closed under limits, \n    $\\varprojlim_{k} \\nu(X \\otimes \\Sigma \\bb{R}P^{\\infty}_{k})$ is $\\tau$-complete. \n    The upshot of this is that it will suffice to prove that the map from \\Cref{eqn:want-iso}\n    is an isomorphism after tensoring with $C\\tau$.\n    \n    Using the fact that $C\\tau$ is dualizable\\footnote{Recall that $C\\tau \\cong \\rm{Cofib}(\\tau : \\bb{S}^{0,-1} \\rightarrow \\bb{S}^{0,0})$, where both $\\bb{S}^{0,-1}$ and $\\bb{S}^{0,0}$ are dualizable.} to commute $C\\tau \\otimes -$ past the limit \n    together with the isomorphism $ C\\tau \\otimes \\nu X \\cong H_{*}(X)$ and the Kunneth isomorphism \n    we reduce further to showing that the map\n    \\[

transition maps in these systems are all surjective).\n    This allows us to pass to the associated graded of the $I$-adic filtration on $H_*(X)$ and prove the desired isomorphism there.\n    Let $K_n \\coloneqq \\rm{fib}(H_{*}(X)\/I^{n+1} \\rightarrow H_{*}(X)\/I^{n})$. \n    We have at this point reduced to showing that \n    \\[ K_n \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k K_n \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\] \n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ for each $n \\geq 0$.\n    \n    At this point we observe that $\\mc{A}_p$ acts trivially on $K_n$\n    and therefore that $K_n \\cong \\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ for a collection of sets $J_i$ with $J_i = \\emptyset$ \n    for $i \\ll 0$. Using fact that this sum is bounded below we have \n    $\\bigoplus_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} \\cong \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i} $.\n    We can furthermore write $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\oplus J_i}$ as a retract of $\\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times I_i}$. At this point it will suffice to show that\n    \\[ \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\to \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i} \\bb{F}_p[i]^{\\times J_i} \\right) \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) \\]\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    Applying \\Cref{lem:colimlim} again to commute the tensor product with $H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k})$ past this product we reduce to showing that\n    $$\\bb{F}_p[i] \\rightarrow \\varprojlim_k \\left( \\bb{F}_p[i] \\otimes H_{*}(\\Sigma P^{\\infty}_{k}) \\right) $$\n    is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$.\n    That this map is an isomorphism is the Ext-isomorphism of \\cite{lin1980conjectures, lin1980calculation, gunawardena1980segal}, which was the key input in proving the Segal conjecture for $X=\\Ss$ and $G=C_p$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem} \\label{lem:colimlim}\n    Let $X \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a finite type $\\mc{A}$-comodule.\n    Let $F : J \\to \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})^\\heartsuit$ be a diagram of $\\mc{A}$-comodules where \n    the $F(j)$ are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading).\n    The natural comparison map \n    \\[ X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) \\to  \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right) \\]\n    in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is an isomorphism.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin by observing that because the collection of functors $\\Ext^{s,t}_{\\mc{A}}(\\F_p, -)$ are jointly conservative on $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ \n    it will suffice to show this map induces isomorphisms on these ext groups.\n    Now we make the key observation.\n    Let $\\CC_m \\subseteq \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ denote the full subcategory consisting of those $Z$ such that $\\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) = 0$ for all $s,t$ with $t < m$.\n    We have $\\F_p[t] \\in \\CC_t$.\n    As each of the shifts $\\F_p[t] \\in \\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ is compact and $\\Ext^{s,t}(\\F_p, Z) \\cong \\pi_{-s}\\Map^{\\Sp}_{\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})}(\\F_p[t], Z)$\n    we can read off the following facts:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item An $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in internal degrees $\\geq m$ is in $\\CC_m$.\n        \\item $\\CC_m$ is closed under limits and colimits.\n        \\item If $M \\in \\CC_m$ and $N \\in \\CC_n$, then $M \\otimes N \\in \\CC_{m+n}$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \n    As $X$ is of finite type, we may write it as a colimit of skeleta $\\colim_{k} X^{(k)}$ where \n    each $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\A$-comodule concentrated in the range $[0,k]$ and the map $X^{(k-1)} \\to X^{(k)}$ is an isomorphism in internal degree $< k$.\n    Let $Y^{(k)} \\coloneqq \\cofib(X^{(k-1)} \\to X)$, then $Y^{(k)}$ is an $\\mc{A}$-comodule concentrated in degrees $\\geq k$.\n    \n    At this point we may conclude that there is an $N$ such that\n    $Y^{(k)} \\otimes \\lim_{J} F(j)$ and $\\lim_K \\left( Y^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)$ are both in $\\CC_{k+N}$. \n    From this we learn that the vertical maps in the diagram below are isomorphisms for $t < k+N$.\n    \\[ \\begin{tikzcd}\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X^{(k)} \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right) ) \\ar[r] \\ar[d] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X^{(k)} \\otimes F(j) \\right)) \\ar[d] \\\\\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, X \\otimes \\left( \\lim_{J} F(j) \\right)) \\ar[r] &\n        \\Ext_{\\mc{A}}^{s,t}(\\F_p, \\lim_J \\left( X \\otimes F(j) \\right))\n    \\end{tikzcd} \\]\n    On the other hand as $X^{(k)}$ is a finite $\\mc{A}$-comodule it is dualizable and therefore the top horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.\n    Allowing $k$ to vary we learn that the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism for all $s,t$ as desired.    \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corr} \\label{cor:lim-underlying}\n    The forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A}) \\to \\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ commutes with \n    limits of diagrams that are uniformly bounded below (with respect to the internal grading) and valued in the heart.\n\\end{corr}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    $\\mc{D}(\\F_p)^{\\mathrm{gr}}$ is isomorphic to modules over $H_*(\\F_p)$ in $\\mathrm{Stable}(\\mc{A})$ and the forgetful functor may therefore be identified with the basechange $H_*(\\F_p) \\otimes -$.\n    The conclusion now follows from the fact that $H_*(\\F_p)$ is locally finite and \\Cref{lem:colimlim}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Examples of $I$-complete spectra} \\label{examples}\n\n\\begin{defn} \\label{defnlocallyfinite}\nGiven a spectrum $X$, we say that it has \\emph{locally finite $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology} if for any element $x \\in H^{*}(X)$, the sub- $\\mc{A}$-module generated by $x$ is finite.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{ex}\n    Let $X$ be a bounded below spectrum whose $\\bb{F}_p$-cohomology is locally finite and of finite type.
