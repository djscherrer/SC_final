In \cite{LPSS-2023}, the authors construct a cochain complex
    $C\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})$ on the cohomology of a moment-angle complex $\ZZ_{\K}$
    and call the resulting cohomology the double cohomology,
    $H\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})$. In this paper, we study the change of
    rank in double cohomology after gluing an $n$-simplex to
    a simplicial complex $\K$ in certain conditions. As an application,
    we give a positive answer to an open problem in \cite{LPSS-2023}:
    For any even integer $r$, there always
    exists a simlicial complex $\K$ such that 
    $\opn{rank} H\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})=r$.
