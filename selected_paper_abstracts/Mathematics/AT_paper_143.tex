The Segal conjecture for $C_p$ (as proved by Lin and Gunawardena) asserts that the canonical map from the $p$-complete sphere spectrum to the Tate construction for the trivial action of $C_p$ on the $p$-complete sphere spectrum is an isomorphism. 
    In this article we extend the collection of spectra for which the canonical map $X \to X^{tC_p}$ is known to be an isomorphism to include any $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum whose mod $p$ homology, viewed a module over the Steenrod algebra, is complete with respect to the maximal ideal $I \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.
