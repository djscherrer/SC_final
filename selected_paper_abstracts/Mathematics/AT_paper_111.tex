We compute the \textit{upper characteristic rank} of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\bb R, \bb C$ and $\bb H$ and of the flip Stiefel manifolds. We provide bounds for the \textit{cup lengths} of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for existence of $S^3$-map between quarternionic Stiefel manifolds using Fadell-Husseini index.
