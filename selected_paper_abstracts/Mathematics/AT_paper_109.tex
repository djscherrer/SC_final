In this paper, we present SIMAP, a novel layer integrated into deep learning models, aimed at enhancing 
the interpretability of the output.
The SIMAP layer is an enhanced version of Simplicial-Map Neural Networks (SMNNs), an 
explainable neural network based on support sets and simplicial maps (functions 
 used in topology to transform shapes while preserving their structural connectivity).
The novelty of the methodology proposed in this paper is two-fold: 
Firstly, SIMAP layers work in combination with other deep learning architectures as an interpretable layer substituting classic dense final layers. 
Secondly, unlike SMNNs,
the support set is based on a fixed maximal simplex, the barycentric subdivision being efficiently computed with a matrix-based multiplication algorithm.
