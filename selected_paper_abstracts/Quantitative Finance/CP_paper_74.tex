This paper aims to develop a supervised deep-learning scheme to compute call option prices for the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model
with a non-martingale asset price process having infinite active jumps.
In our deep learning scheme, teaching data is generated through the Monte Carlo method developed by Arai and Imai \cite{AI}.
Moreover, the BNS model includes many variables, which makes the deep learning accuracy worse.
Therefore, we will create another input variable using the Black-Scholes formula. As a result, the accuracy is improved dramatically. \\
