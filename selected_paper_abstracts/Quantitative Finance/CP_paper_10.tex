This paper studies a {\em risk-sensitive} decision-making problem under uncertainty. It considers a decision-making process that unfolds over a fixed number of stages, in which a decision-maker chooses among multiple alternatives, some of which are deterministic and others are stochastic. The decision-maker's cumulative value is updated at each stage, reflecting the outcomes of the chosen alternatives. After formulating this as a stochastic control problem, we delineate the necessary optimality conditions for it. Two illustrative examples from optimal betting and inventory management are provided to support our theory.
