In prior methods, it was observed that the application of Convolutional Neural Networks agent in Deep Reinforcement Learning to financial data resulted in an enhanced reward.\cite{montazeri2023scnnFinrl} In this study, a specific permutation was applied to the feature vector, thereby generating a CNN matrix that strategically positions more pertinent features in close proximity. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations unequivocally demonstrate a substantial enhancement in reward attainment.
