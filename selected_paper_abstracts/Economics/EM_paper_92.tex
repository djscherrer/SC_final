This paper proposes a fast Markov Matrix-based methodology for computing Top Trading Cycles (TTC) that delivers O(1) computational speed, that is speed independent of the number of agents and objects in the system. The proposed methodology is well suited for complex large-dimensional problems like housing choice. The methodology retains all the properties of TTC, namely, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality and strategy-proofness.
