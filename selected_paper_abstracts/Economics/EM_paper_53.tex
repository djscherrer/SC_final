A new methodology is proposed to approximate the time-dependent house price distribution at a fine regional scale using Gaussian mixtures. The means, variances and weights of the mixture components are related to time, location and dwelling type through a non linear function trained by a deep functional approximator. Price indices are derived as means, medians, quantiles or other functions of the estimated distributions. Price densities for larger regions, such as a city, are calculated via a weighted sum of the component density functions. The method is applied to a data set covering all of Australia at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. In addition to enabling a detailed exploration of the data, the proposed index yields lower prediction errors in the practical task of individual dwelling price projection from previous sales values within the three major Australian cities.  The estimated quantiles are also found to be well calibrated empirically, capturing the complexity of house price distributions.
