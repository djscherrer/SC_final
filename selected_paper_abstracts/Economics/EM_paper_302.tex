A common approach to constructing a Synthetic Control unit is to fit on the outcome variable and covariates in pre-treatment time periods, but it has been shown by \cite{ImperfectFit} that this approach does not provide asymptotic unbiasedness when the fit is imperfect and the number of controls is fixed. Many related panel methods have a similar limitation when the number of units is fixed. I introduce and evaluate a new method in which the Synthetic Control is constructed using a General Method of Moments approach where units not being included in the Synthetic Control are used as instruments. I show that a Synthetic Control Estimator of this form will be asymptotically unbiased as the number of pre-treatment time periods goes to infinity, even when pre-treatment fit is imperfect and the number of units is fixed. Furthermore, if both the number of pre-treatment and post-treatment time periods go to infinity, then averages of treatment effects can be consistently estimated. I conduct simulations and an empirical application to compare the performance of this method with existing approaches in the literature.
