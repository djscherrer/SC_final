We numerically study the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles.  Following the recently established result that the $q$-normal  describes the smooth form of the eigenvalue density of the $k$-body embedded ensembles, the first four moments of the distribution of lowest eigenvalues have been analyzed as a function of the $q$ parameter, with $q \sim 1$ for $k = 1$ and $q = 0$ for $k = m$; $m$ being the number of bosons.  Our results show the distribution exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like  for $q$ close to 1 to a modified Gumbel like for intermediate values of $q$ to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution for $q=0$.
