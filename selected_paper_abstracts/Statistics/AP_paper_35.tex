Singular-value statistics (SVS) has been recently presented as a random matrix theory
tool able to properly characterize non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles [PRX Quantum {\bf 4}, 040312 (2023)].
Here, we perform a numerical study of the SVS of the non-Hermitian adjacency matrices
$\mathbf{A}$ of directed random graphs, where $\mathbf{A}$ are members of diluted real 
Ginibre ensembles. 
We consider two models of directed random graphs: Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs and random regular graphs.
Specifically, we focus on the ratio $r$ between nearest neighbor singular values 
and the minimum singular value $\lambda_{\tbox{min}}$.
We show that $\langle r \rangle$ (where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ represents ensemble average) 
can effectively characterize the transition between mostly 
isolated vertices to almost complete graphs, while the probability density function of $\lambda_{\tbox{min}}$ 
can clearly distinguish between different graph models.
