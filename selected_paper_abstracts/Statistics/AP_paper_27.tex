Despite the earlier claim of "Death of Distance", recent studies revealed that geographical proximity still greatly influences link formation in online social networks. However, it is unclear how physical distances are intertwined with users' online behaviors in a virtual world. We study the role of spatial dependence on a global online social network with a dyadic Logit model. Results show country-specific patterns for distance effect on probabilities to build connections. Effects are stronger when the possibility for two people to meet in person exists. Relative to weak ties, dependence on proximity is looser for strong social ties.
