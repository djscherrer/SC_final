The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, prompting a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and coauthorship dynamics on research output. Using a novel dataset, this paper endeavors to make a first cut at investigating the role of peer effects on the productivity of economics scholars, measured by the number of publications, in both pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Results show that peer effect is significant for the pre-pandemic time but not for the pandemic time. The findings contribute to our understanding of how research collaboration influences knowledge production and may help guide policies aimed at fostering collaboration and enhancing research productivity in the academic community.
